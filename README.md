### Hi there 
I'm Tom Laird-McConnell. I am a retired software engineer who got his start as a teenager writing software for commodore computers.  
I spent over 30 years of my career at Microsoft where I worked on things as diverse as networking software, kids software, search engines and conversation AI.
